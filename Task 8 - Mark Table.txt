5. Marks Entry (foreign key to All the above tables) 

Solution:
=======

// Department Master table
CREATE TABLE DepartmentMaster (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

//Subject Master table
CREATE TABLE SubjectMaster (
    subject_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_id INT,
    subject_name VARCHAR(50),
    max_marks INT,
    min_marks INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES DepartmentMaster(department_id)
);

//Student Master
CREATE TABLE StudentMaster (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_id INT,
    student_name VARCHAR(50),
    address VARCHAR(100),
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES DepartmentMaster(department_id)
);


//Semester Master table
CREATE TABLE SemesterMaster (
    semester_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_id INT,
    semester_name VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES DepartmentMaster(department_id)
);


//Marks Entry table
CREATE TABLE MarksEntry (
    marks_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    department_id INT,
    semester_id INT,
    subject_id INT,
    marks_obtained INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES StudentMaster(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES DepartmentMaster(department_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (semester_id) REFERENCES SemesterMaster(semester_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (subject_id) REFERENCES SubjectMaster(subject_id)
);
